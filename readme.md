# Notes Application with Python!

Hi, in this case I've made a small application that conects Python with MongoDB through Pymongo. I tried to achieve a system which allows you to register, login, add and delete notes.

Since I'm a Python fan I enjoyed the process and learned a bit of things such as ternary conditionals and assertions. I'm in love with Python and i'd love to learn more about it.

Any feedback or comment is well received, hope you like it!

You can run the application thru **notes.py**
